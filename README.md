## Explainable algorithm for melanoma detection using deep neural networks and game theory

_________________

This is the Pytorch official implementation of the framework proposed in the paper [Explainable algorithm for melanoma detection using deep neural networks and game theory](https:) which is under revision for the Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine journal.
### Abstract figure

![Alt text](proposed_framework.png?raw=true "HMLoss")
### Dependency
The code is build with following main libraries
- [Pytorch](https://www.tensorflow.org) 1.11.0
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) 
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
